Improving Real-Time Bank Transactions with a Thread Pool
Instead of creating new thread objects multiple times, a real-world approach would be to use a thread pool (ExecutorService). This ensures:

Efficient thread management.
Avoids unnecessary thread creation overhead.
Enables continuous processing of multiple transactions dynamically.

 * How This Improves Real-Time Implementation
âœ… 1. Efficient Thread Management
Uses a fixed pool of reusable threads instead of creating new thread objects.
Reduces overhead compared to creating new Thread instances.
âœ… 2. Dynamically Handles Transactions
Instead of manually creating threads for every transaction, we submit tasks dynamically using executorService.submit().
This approach scales better for real-time banking applications.
âœ… 3. Graceful Shutdown
executorService.shutdown() ensures all transactions are completed before stopping.
Prevents memory leaks from unmanaged threads.

Key Takeaways for an Interview
Instead of creating Thread objects manually, use ExecutorService for better performance.
Executors.newFixedThreadPool(n) ensures only n threads are active at a time, reducing system strain.
Real-time banking systems queue transactions rather than handling them in isolated threads.
ðŸš€ This approach mirrors real-world banking transaction processing!
